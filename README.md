# ShootySquareGame
I don't want to lose the precious versions of my shooty square game.

Version 0.1 - Movement for player and basic environment added.

Version 0.2 - Added a gun that shoots (no sounds effects and doesn't do damage). Scaled up all of the objects so the detail of the gun could be seen a little better. 

Upcoming: Better movement. Meaning the jumps feel less floaty and more like mario... kinda. Enemy AI will be implemented. Health bars will be added for both player and enemy.
